I am Anandh, a theoretical physics student at IISER Pune. This is my personal webpage where I will be sharing my thoughts on various topics. I am particularly interested in theoretical aspects of physics, especially quantum field theory and general relativity. I also have a keen interest in mathematics and its applications in physics. I consider myself a lifelong learner and I am always eager to explore any thing what catches my interest. I believe in knowledge as an activity with an intrinsic purpose of its own. Thus, I quote:

“The Scholar resists the reduction of knowledge to a tool. I refuse the instrumentalisation of inquiry.”

Everything is fun when you are passionate about it. I hope to share my passion for learning and knowledge through this webpage. This is a result of such a pursuit and exploration.
