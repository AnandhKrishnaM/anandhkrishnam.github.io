* Geodesic Equation EQN

$$ \frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d \lambda^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^\alpha }{d \lambda} \frac{d x^\beta}{d\lambda} = 0$$

   Writing geodesic Deviation equation in terms of Riemann tensor we get 
   $$ \frac{D^2 \xi^\mu}{d \lambda^2} = R^\mu_{\nu \alpha \beta} \xi^\nu \frac{d x^\alpha}{d \lambda} \frac{d x^\beta}{d \lambda}$$
where $$ \xi^\mu$$ is the deviation vector and $$ \frac{D}{d \lambda}$$ is the covariant derivative along the geodesic path. This equation is called Jacobi equation.
