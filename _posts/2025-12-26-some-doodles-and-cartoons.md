Just posting some doodles and cartoons I made recently, while I getting bored during my work. Finding some place to dump them - Academic life, according to cats, rabbits and all of that.

*Cattidvice — Stare at the paper until it becomes obsolete. This usually takes 5–7 years.*

*Rabbittdvice — Ignore deadlines. True wisdom is timeless—and so are cats and rabbits.*
