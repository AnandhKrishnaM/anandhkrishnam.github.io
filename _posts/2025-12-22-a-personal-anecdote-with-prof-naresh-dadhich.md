This is a post in memory of Prof. Naresh Dadhich and I would like to share a personal anecdote that highlights his influence on my academic journey.This is my first blog writing here. I was confused about how to start writing a blog post. So, I decided to share a personal anecdote about my interaction with Prof. Naresh Dadhich. 

I write this post to preserve a personal memory and intellectual influence of Prof. Naresh Dadhich, whose guidance and way of thinking shaped my approach to general relativity and gravitational physics and life in general.

This note is not a technical article. Instead, it is a **personal reflection** on interactions, conversations, and lessons that left a lasting impression on my academic journey.

I have written a short document describing this anecdote in detail.

For readers who would like a longer, self-contained version of this recollection, I’ve compiled the full write-up as a PDF:

<div style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: 1px solid #444;">
  <iframe 
    src="{{ '/assets/pdf/Anecdote.pdf' | relative_url }}" 
    width="100%" 
    height="100%" 
    style="border: none;">
  </iframe>
</div>

*This post is intended as a personal record and tribute.*
